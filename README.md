# JAMES_ECCOv4r4_Analysis

A collection of scripts and Jupyter notebooks used to derive the results for "The global overturning circulation and the role of non-equilibrium effects in ECCOv4r4,"  to be submitted to Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems. Scrips and notebooks are labeled in the order they should be run to reproduce our results. Data is taken from the ECCOv4r4 repository hosted on PO.DAAC. Some modification to these scripts may be necessary due to frequent changes in ECCO output format.
